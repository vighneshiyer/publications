    can't you tell I'm trying to unify physical science and abstract math, even though they don't really seem to fit together?
    - Oh, this is just the scientific method? Yes, obviously.
    - Godel's incompleteness theorem
      - Can't know everything from first principles
    - Heisenburg's uncertainty principle
      - Only can get approximate models, not the truth itself
    - Failure to explain various natural phenomena (see unanswered questions in physics)

    <h2>Evolved Systems</h2>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
ML is powerful when it can break engineered abstractions and can mimic naturally evolved systems
It isn't powerful when it is forced into a box defined by prior engineering efforts (e.g. surrogate functions, fixed abstractions)

The MNIST lesson
Compare Semantic segmentation using all 3 systems
Evolved antennas
The major caveat to the bitter lesson - feasibility matters. Fuzziness vs exactness matters. Engineered vs natural systems matter.
FSD vs traditional approaches
the rendering example
  - will the input and output of the ML model be engineered systems (rendering engine, formal geometry, camera trajectory) or will it be a series of images and give me some voxel maps and camera position?
ML in the loop, out of the loop, and end-to-end (i.e. generative)
Language models vs classical linguistics / NLP

ML for Surrogate Functions for Engineered Algorithms - QoR prediction / one-shot synthesis
Out of distribution issues (natural systems don't suffer from this) (evolved engineered systems trying to mimic engineered ones will fail this - fail to generalize, which isn't a problem for natural or purely engineered systems)
ML for RTL simulation
Why did AlphaChip fail? In principle, ML for placement would be way better wrt runtime and QoR vs algorithmic / manual heuristic techniques
End to end ML - The Altman Plan
LLMs for RTL engineering
The AI scientist - high potential for drug discovery (mechanical search), low potential for true discovery (not so mechanical)
