Agile hardware design methodologies enable small teams to build complex SoCs by rethinking the existing hardware design paradigm, which requires hundreds, if not thousands of engineers to build SoCs.

In the first part of the talk, we will review Chipyard and FireSim which are tools that open up possibilities to agile hardware development by enabling rapid SoC designs and simulation.

In the second part of the talk, we will present our views, as hardware designers, about potential innovations in design abstractions, languages, and simulators to deliver a paradigm shift in hardware design.
We will discuss the importance of a rapid iteration loop, ideas for mixed-abstraction design frontends, semantics-preserving IRs, and how all these fit into our existing infrastructure.
