    - [x] Imperative control flow is annoying and error-prone to turn into an FSM
    - [x] Often we want to compose HLS-generated control flow machines with explicit RTL state
    - [x] Also we want to have precise cycle-level control of the control flow
    - [x] Can we design an API to do this automatically?
    - [x] Give an example
- Col 2 / 3
    - [x] We present an API for recipes based on Blarney's recipe construct
    - [x] Introduce the primitives
    - [x] Show that recipes are compositional (pieces can be defined separately and then integrated)
    - [x] Give examples of recipes for AXI slave and DecoupledGCD
    - [x] Show how recipes are compiled with the go -> (active, done) interface
- Col 4
    - [x] Talk about debugging features with source locators
        - [x] Waveform signal debugging
        - [x] Printf debugging
    - [x] Conclusion
        - The power of embedded DSLs with existing embedded HDLs!
        - Next steps: optimized recipes with static analysis (minimal state), PPA analysis, bounded fork/join functionality, show utility in real examples
