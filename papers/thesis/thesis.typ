= Preface

The topic of this thesis is quite out of left field to be honest.

// undergraduate experience
== Undergrad Time

When I began my undergraduate education at UC Berkeley in 2013, I knew I wanted to broadly learn about topics in the field of electrical engineering and computer science, but did not have any speciality in mind.
I took the usual EECS curriculum which covered topics up and down the stack: analog/RF circuits, digital circuits, VLSI, computer architecture, operating systems, embedded systems, DSP, optimization, software engineering, and AI/ML.
I also thought I should supplement the engineering-oriented classes with some more "theoretical" ones so I took a bunch of random statistics classes before realizing I'm not cut out for that.

It wasn't until I took Berkeley's introduction to digital circuits and logic course (EECS 151) that I found something I was genuinely interested in.
At the same time, I also found the analog and RF circuits courses interesting, so I decided to pursue research in computer architecture and further down the stack.

// teaching eecs151
== Undergrad Teaching

While I was an undergrad, I was a TA for Berkeley's digital circuits course (EECS151) a few times.
This was one of the best experiences I had during my time at Berkeley.

Certainly, teaching a subject is the best way to learn it.
The first time I was a TA, I made many mistakes when explaining concepts to students or helping them on homework.
Teaching made me realize just how little I understood the material after having just taken the same class the prior semester.
Only after teaching for a while, do you have enough understanding to write new materials for the course.

There is something very valuable about teaching the same material over and over again: you realize quickly that a 'curriculum' is never actually done.
Students pick up on the smallest mistakes in the textbook, labs, homeworks, and projects.
They get annoyed quickly when some script fails to run or if the lab fails to hold their interest.
The lesson I learned: contemporary computer architecture and digital design education is still far away from how good it could be.

// chip bringup
== Undergrad Research

Near the end of my undergrad career, I got involved in some "research", which was really just helping grad students with a chip bringup.
Honestly, I didn't even help that much, and instead I was quite an annoyance, asking lots of questions, and making slow progress.
I owe a large debt to the senior grad students who patiently explained the hardware and software components of the chip they built.

Eventually, I was able to lead the bringup of SERDES links on the chip!
The goal was for the SoC's RISC-V cores to access external DRAM (hosted on a FPGA devboard) via these SERDES links.
This was designed to be much faster than using our slow parallel bus from the chip to the FPGA.
This would bring this academic SoC's performance closer to that of a real SoC which would have an integrated DDR controller and PHY.

As usual, things usually don't work out as you would like.
While the SERDES links managed to stay up and synchronized for a few seconds, eventually the clock skew calibration would drift out of phase (there was no CDR on the chip's RX) and the BER would explode.
However, we were able to run some quick tests during the time the link stayed alive, and that was sufficient to get a number.
People outside this field would be surprised and disappointed upon seeing that academic chips _barely_ work.

// power modeling (this was a bit too random to mention here)

== Motivation for Grad School

So, why even bother going to grad school?
When I was about done with my undergraduate education, I had plenty of opportunities to jump into any random SWE job in the Bay.
But, I felt I _knew nothing_ about what I just learned.
Sure, I had gone through the motions: taking a bunch of classes, building a few projects, and doing well on exams, but none of this gave me enough grounding to pursue independent research like I wanted to.

My motivation for going to graduate school was to gain an encyclopedic understanding of computer architecture and all its adjacent fields.
Unlike the common conception of graduate school as a place where you become an ultra-specialized researcher who knows little outside their speciality, the environment at Berkeley is quite different.
Our lab is a place where, through building real systems, you inevitably end up learning about every part of the stack.
It is this ability to constantly build things from scratch without any preconceived objectives (i.e. publish a paper) that grants you encyclopedic knowledge.

== Applying to Grad School

When I sat down to write my application, my high-level interest was sitting at the edge of analog and digital circuits in the context of building large digital SoCs.
I decided to write my statement of purpose (SoP) in an unorthodox way.
I planned to propose a concrete line of research based on my interests in my SoP, with the idea that a professor would really appreciate it if I knew exactly what I wanted to build.
Specifically, since I was interested in asynchronous circuits and timing closure at the time, I proposed to investigate some problems in the design methodology, physical design, automated timing analysis, and circuit design aspects of globally-asynchronous, locally-synchronous (GALS)

Of course, this backfired and instead turned off PIs who thought that this was my only specific interest, and if they weren't working on a similar idea, that I would not be interested.
Even still, I was lucky enough to have several offers from PIs in areas outside GALS implementation techniques 😆.

// starting with analog circuits and INC prelim
== The First Two Years

When I started my PhD, I had no clue what I was actually interested in, and more importantly, what was worth doing.
Whatever interest I had claimed in my SoP was from the topics I was reading at the time.
Since I had some interest in analog and RF circuits too, I decided to take classes in that area and prepare for the integrated circuits preliminary exam.

Soon, I realized that analog circuit design wasn't in my blood.
It is nice to start with some first principles (i.e. equation-based transistor models that humans can understand), pick a topology, and size the transistors.
But after that point, you do the layout, run some parasitic-extracted simulations, realize your idealized circuit models used for the first principles analysis were completely wrong, and then go crazy with parameter sweeping.
I just couldn't get with the program: this didn't feel like systematic engineering, but rather felt like trying random things until something worked.

It was obvious I should change my primary field away from integrated circuits, but I still needed to take the prelim exam.
The first time, I failed the exam, and rightly so; my skills in analog design were poor, and my interest was fading.
After passing the prelim exam (on my second attempt), I decided to move up the stack and work on projects in computer architecture.

// working through early stage research projects in my PhD
== Learning More Things

After that point, I explored a bunch of areas within computer architecture, and learned new things every time I started from scratch.
None of my explorations and projects ended in anything grand, because I didn't have any unifying vision in mind: I was exploring subjects that came to my or my advisor's attention.
I played some role in a bunch of projects including:

- Power macromodeling for random RTL blocks
- RTL and verification for a systolic GEMM accelerator (Gemmini)
- Fault injection (soft error model) and AVF estimation
- RTL design of various blocks
- Specification mining for RTL bug localization
- Hardware verification projects including fuzzing, RISC-V stimulus generation, monadic testbench API, coverage instrumentation libraries

Ultimately, these were all disconnected efforts and there wasn't a way to unify them into some grand vision.
But, every project was valuable: I learned something about each piece of the stack, and every project got me closer to my goal of encyclopedic knowledge.

// eventually coming to simulation as the king of tools
// the reality of microarchitecture simulation sampling today and the work that remains to be done
== Simulation is King

When I reflected on the random things I did in the past, one thing became clear: all computer architecture work relies on _a few fundamental techniques_.
They include, a language that enables modeling or implementation of hardware, representative workloads that the hardware is designed to execute efficiently, and a simulation framework to estimate performance (and other VLSI metrics) of the hardware you are designing.

Of these, the place where I could make the largest impact, as a single student, was _simulation methodology_.
In particular, the workhorse of our hardware design methodology is RTL simulation, and it is frequently the bottleneck when it comes to iterating on a hardware design.
If we can improve the throughput and latency of the RTL simulator, while preserving its fidelity, it would be a general-purpose win for hardware designers.

== Sampled Simulation

// Some words about the inspiration behind this project and how it came to be.
//sudden shift to sampled simulation due to higher potential impact and an uncrowded area.

In this thesis, I will describe the creation and evaluation of a framework for sampled simulation of RTL.
But none of the ideas in this thesis are _"original"_ per se.
Rather, sampling in the context of hardware simulation has a long history going back to the early 2000s.

There have been countless papers published about sampled hardware simulation (I would estimate upwards of 200 papers at "top-tier" conferences, many of which I will summarize in this thesis).
When I would express interest in working on sampling, people would often comment: "Isn't sampling already done to death?".
Of course, this just means many papers have been published, but it says nothing about

Isn't sampling done to death?
People say this and just point to papers. But this is paper-brained nonsense.
Sampling doesn't even exist today from my real-life perspective.
That combined with interest from industry, made me realize that this fields isn't truly explored to its conclusion. And even after I worked on this topic, there are infinite avenues open to continued exploration. Not a hot area anymore though.

= Introduction

== The Digital Hardware Landscape

Digital hardware is ubiquitous.
Everywhere we look, no matter the form factor, application, or
Watches, phones, IoT devices, home appliances, urban infrastructure (traffic lights, trains), cars, robots, datacenters
we find digital systems
Chip landscape overall
Refer to the typical DAC / job talks

- Microprocessors dominate how we interact with digital electronics. Phones, tablets, laptops, watches, and servers in datacenters (the cloud).
- How has microprocessors evolved over the past 50 years?
- The very first unicore processors and operating systems
- Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling
- Dual core processors to counteract some poor scaling trends and improve real time performance
- DVFS technologies for power savings and to deal with increasing process variation
- Multicore processors continue to proliferate
- Mixed perf/energy efficiency processors (big/little architecture)
- The failure of the PARLAB vision (discuss the 7 dwarves as they seemed to provide opportunity for general purpose scaling machines, but it didn't pan out. they were mostly for HPC apps. when attempted to apply onto manycore systems and general applications like web browsers, they break down right away)
- Dark silicon
- Software engineers are dominant, we must align to what they want and accelerate their common stacks
- Continued performance improvements of single thread performance. Process scaling and uarch improvements continue to compound every generation going from the Nehelem era to the failure of Bulldozer/Itanium and into the Zen era we see today.
- The Apple breakthroughs on both the smartphone and laptop side (A14+ and M1+ series of chips)
- True software optimized hardware, continued scaling of performance, Speedometer performance continues to improve every generation even as process improvements stagnate or come at an increasing cost
- Accelerators are there, but are they the primary target of phone/tablets/laptops today? Even in the distant future? Probably not.
- Use GPT to chart this outline and fill in any missing holes.
- What does this portend?
  - How does Apple do their co-design today? It is iterative over many generations of silicon. On-device tracing and trace-based simulation. Software optimizations done after the fact.
  - Basically, the iteration loop is still very slow! True optimization of the end-to-end application with the microarchitecture is not possible, even with emulation machines.

Fortunately, the challenges of the Dark Silicon era [ 3] have transitioned into a prosperous period of specialized accelera- tor design [ 4 , 5 ]. Emerging enabling technology and tools for agile and democratized hardware design are powering an exciting land

== Software Trends

Software drives the next generation hardware whether we like it or not. To some degree hardware advancements make software advancements / inefficiencies possible in the first place. So we must discuss the software first.
Software stack complexity continues to grow with more abstractions, consider webapp side
Programming productivity is king, more SW engineers vs HW ones
Cloud and edge application stacks are actually converging with respect to compute characteristics (indirect dispatch, JITs, VMs, more isolation), with differences in scale

== Digital Hardware Trends

Moore's Law, Dennard scaling, specialization, heterogeneous systems, more custom IPs
But CPUs aren't stagnating! Show performance results of M series systems on Speedometer. Energy efficiency and absolute performance continue to improve as cores are designed with specialized features for target workloads (e.g. speculation features such as load address/value prediction, pointer preemptive prefetching, things that expose uarch side-channels actually are good!)
Core microarchitecture iteration is still important! But performance benefits are hard to measure due to simulation bottlenecks.



- Digital hardware is everywhere, especially on your phone, laptop, desktop, and through the cloud (datacenters)
- Scaling trends of microprocessors
- Accelerators galore
- But what do accelerators do for you? Consider your phone. What do you use it for? What role do these accelerators play?
- Single-thread performance is still king
- But it isn't scaling? Not true! Vertical integration gives continual benefits. Speedometer scores are the key. Energy efficiency of cores continues to improve. Cores themselves have become more heterogeneous.
- But how does this work in practice? There is no vertical iteration loop prior to tape out? So, there is still a full silicon spin cycle + software development time to figure out optimizations. How does Apple do it? Why do others lag so far behind?


== Motivation

== Hypothesis

\subsection{Our Proposal}

% Sampled multi-level simulation!
To achieve high throughput we will leverage simulation sampling techniques, but instead of using architectural simulators for performance metric estimation, we will use RTL simulators.
We specifically employ a sampling methodology similar to SimPoint, but with functional warmup and shorter interval lengths.

\subsubsection{Why Use RTL Simulators?}

% Why multi-level simulation? Why not arch sim 2-level sim? Why go down to RTL?
% Why not just go into perf simulators?
% Don't want to design perf model and then design RTL to match that - what a waste, not agile!
% Aren't "trends" enough? Not when we care about small IPC changes! The absolute number matters!
% Miscorrelation vs RTL *compounds* over simulation time!
% the correlation problem gets compounded 2x - sampling error + perf sim - RTL sim correlation errors
% Also what are the special things we can get from RTL simulation that perf sim can't get us?

Existing sampled simulators mix functional simulators and architectural simulators (e.g. gem5, Sniper, SST).
We continue to use functional warmup models similar to those in architectural simulators, but we use RTL simulation for extracting performance metrics.

\paragraph{What is the benefit of introducing RTL simulators into the mix?}

For one, it has been shown that performance simulators can be wildly inaccurate\cite{arch_sim_considered_harmful, arch_sim_survey} and often have unbounded modeling errors in addition to sampling errors, while RTL simulation is cycle-accurate.
Also, using RTL simulation for performance estimation means there is no need to perform correlation between the performance simulators and RTL.

Having RTL also enables us to derive accurate PPA numbers for the SoC as a whole using a traditional synthesis flow, whereas performance simulators can at best give vague estimates.
Since our flow already leverages sampled simulation for performance trace estimation, we can apply a similar flow to extrapolate a full power trace using post-RTL power estimation CAD tools.

Finally, RTL simulators produce special collateral that cannot be produced from performance simulators, such as RTL-level waveforms and detailed microarchitectural events.
Thus, we can obtain many short waveforms that reflect unique aspects of the simulated workloads, suitable for applications ranging from power modeling to coverpoint synthesis.

\paragraph{Why was mixing RTL simulation with sampled simulation not attempted before?}

% We can't try to 'fix' perf models. And in the new open source research era we have RTL! for every part of the system too! we can draw realistic conclusions finally! cite Chipyard, ESP, OpenPiton

In order to use RTL simulation, you need to have RTL for the design point that you are trying to evaluate.
In the past, this has been difficult since the only available open-source RTL was low quality, low performance, poorly parameterizable, and not extensible.
Furthermore, to use RTL simulation with sampling requires a way to restore and resume simulation from architectural checkpoints: this can tightly couple the low-level state injection logic with a specific RTL design point.

Recently, we have seen an explosion of design frameworks with high quality open-source RTL for every part of a complete SoC\cite{chipyard, open_esp, openpiton, xiangshan, pulpv2, blackparrot}.
These design frameworks support extensive parameterization, easy integration of external RTL, and can leverage hardware compiler frameworks\cite{firrtl} to automate generation of state injection code.
It has now become possible to leverage RTL for large workload simulation and microarchitectural design space exploration.

\subsubsection{Why Use SimPoint-Style Sampling?}

% fine time-granularity, high liklihood of unique traces, eventual ability to extrapolate across workloads via binary-agnostic embedding similarity

SMARTs-style sampling only gives us a single number for a performance metric (e.g. IPC).
While it can be more accurate and have statistical error bounds, the intervals chosen for simulation are often redundant (i.e. they have similar microarchitectural characteristics).
When performing microarchitectural exploration, we often want a detailed view of IPC behaviors \textit{within} a workload's trace to, for example, diagnose pathological behaviors visible as unexpected IPC spikes.

SimPoint-style sampling uses interval embeddings and clustering, so the intervals chosen for simulation are at least guaranteed to have unique basic block traversal patterns.
This form of sampling gives us interval length time-granularity of the IPC trace.
Furthermore, if we can develop binary-agnostic interval embeddings, it will allow the simulator to extrapolate performance metrics \textit{across workloads} which have intervals with similar embeddings.

= Sampled Simulation Leveraging RTL Simulation

After understanding the workload characteristics based on prior work and our investigation in the prior chapter, our next step is to build a prototype of a sampled simulation framework that uses RTL simulation to estimate performance metrics.
In contrast to the traditional approach to sampled simulation, which rely on either execution or trace driven CPU performance models, we leverage a very detailed RTL simulation of a particular CPU microarchitecture.

\end{figure}

A high-level overview of the TidalSim flow is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tidalsim_overview}.
The steps of the flow are:

1. Call a functional simulator with a workload binary to get a commit log (contains PC, decoded instruction, register operands, and memory transactions for each committed instruction)
2. Split the commit log into intervals with a fixed number of instructions
3. Embed each interval using its basic block frequency vector
4. Cluster the interval embeddings using k-means clustering
5. Pick intervals closest to each cluster's centroid for simulation
6. Re-execute functional simulation to extract architectural checkpoints for each chosen interval and execute the microarchitectural warmup models to produce microarchitectural checkpoints
7. Inject each checkpoint into RTL simulation and measure performance metrics
8. Extrapolate each simulated interval's performance to produce a performance trace for the full workload

  - They already make the case that the answer is no and things will continue to get worse...
  - This was understood in 1996 lol

  https://arxiv.org/html/2408.05912v1 (Correct Wrong Path - an attempt to make Champsim aware of wrong path execution effects since those are hidden in a trace, unless explicitly instrumented)

\subsection{Limitations of Trace-Driven Simulation}
.
- Disprove trace driven sim first
  - Start with a single-threaded baremetal application that has no IO interactions at all except DRAM
  - Consider how to model performance impacts of
  - Then consider interaction with a DMA device
  - Then consider other IO devices e.g. NIC
  - Then consider the impact of an OS (thread multiplexing on a single hart)
  - Then consider time-dependent behavior e.g. with a timer for interrupt scheduling (for an OS)
  - Then consider the multi-threaded case
    - Some people think that multi-threaded trace-driven simulation is viable: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5762718 but this is very fishy
  - Finally consider the M:N userspace scheduling case for a IO bound application with very high concurrency. Does the 'trace' mean anything anymore? Do we capture the application-level metrics with IPC? This is what actually matters. Does the change in IPC/mispredict rate/etc actually deliver better end-to-end performance or tail latency effects?
    - See TailBench: https://people.csail.mit.edu/sanchez/papers/2016.tailbench.iiswc.pdf

- Ipc doesn't matter if it's spinning the scheduler thread, need app level metrics
- Dr traces induce 30x core slowdown and memory bw contention and cache pollution
- Fake results when fed into trace driven sim, io appears faster than reality

And then the full flow from dbt sim to ice emulation
DBT sim -> ISA-level SoC sim -> execution-driven uArch / perf sim -> RTL sim -> Palladium-ish RTL sim -> ICE


identify your thesis, gather minimal evidence to prove your point and no more
leverage firesim to do trace driven sampling analysis first!!! then move to rtl injection after
  - basically do oracle embedding analysis
