When I started my PhD I had no clue what I was actually interested in, and more importantly, what was worth doing.
I suggested a completely stupid line of research when coming into grad school.
I realized that analog circuit design wasn't in my blood. It is nice to start with some first principles, design a circuit, and size the transistors. But after that point, you do the layout, run some simulations, realize your idealized circuit models used for the first principles analysis were completely wrong, and then go crazy with parameter sweeping. I just couldn't get with the program - it was obvious I needed a change.

Some words about the inspiration behind this project and how it came to be.
TBD.
