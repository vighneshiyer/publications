  abstract = {Hardware specialization, in the form of accelerators that provide custom datapath and control for specific algorithms and applications, promises impressive performance and energy advantages compared to traditional architectures. Current research in accelerator analysis relies on RTL-based synthesis flows to produce accurate timing, power, and area estimates. Such techniques not only require significant effort and expertise but are also slow and tedious to use, making large design space exploration infeasible. To overcome this problem, we present Aladdin, a pre-RTL, power-performance accelerator modeling framework and demonstrate its application to system-on-chip (SoC) simulation. Aladdin estimates performance, power, and area of accelerators within 0.9\%, 4.9\%, and 6.6\% with respect to RTL implementations. Integrated with architecture-level core and memory hierarchy simulators, Aladdin provides researchers an approach to model the power and performance of accelerators in an SoC environment},

  abstract = {Two major trends in high-performance computing, namely, larger numbers of cores and the growing size of on-chip cache memory, are creating significant challenges for evaluating the design space of future processor architectures. Fast and scalable simulations are therefore needed to allow for sufficient exploration of large multi-core systems within a limited simulation time budget. By bringing together accurate high-abstraction analytical models with fast parallel simulation, architects can trade off accuracy with simulation speed to allow for longer application runs, covering a larger portion of the hardware design space. Interval simulation provides this balance between detailed cycle-accurate simulation and one-IPC simulation, allowing long-running simulations to be modeled much faster than with detailed cycle-accurate simulation, while still providing the detail necessary to observe core-uncore interactions across the entire system. Validations against real hardware show average absolute errors within 25\% for a variety of multi-threaded workloads; more than twice as accurate on average as one-IPC simulation. Further, we demonstrate scalable simulation speed of up to 2.0 MIPS when simulating a 16-core system on an 8-core SMP machine.},

  abstract = {Current software-based microarchitecture simulators are many orders of magnitude slower than the hardware they simulate. Hence, most microarchitecture design studies draw their conclusions from drastically truncated benchmark simulations that are often inaccurate and misleading. This paper presents the Sampling Microarchitecture Simulation (SMARTS) framework as an approach to enable fast and accurate performance measurements of full-length benchmarks. SMARTS accelerates simulation by selectively measuring in detail only an appropriate benchmark subset. SMARTS prescribes a statistically sound procedure for configuring a systematic sampling simulation run to achieve a desired quantifiable confidence in estimates.Analysis of 41 of the 45 possible SPEC2K benchmark/input combinations show CPI and energy per instruction (EPI) can be estimated to within ±3\% with 99.7\% confidence by measuring fewer than 50 million instructions per benchmark. In practice, inaccuracy in microarchitectural state initialization introduces an additional uncertainty which we empirically bound to ∼2\% for the tested benchmarks. Our implementation of SMARTS achieves an actual average error of only 0.64\% on CPI and 0.59\% on EPI for the tested benchmarks, running with average speedups of 35 and 60 over detailed simulation of 8-way and 16-way out-of-order processors, respectively.},
