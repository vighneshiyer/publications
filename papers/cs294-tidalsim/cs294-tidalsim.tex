\begin{abstract}

Existing approaches to microarchitecture simulation cannot simultaneouly deliver the three goals of high throughput, low latency, and high fidelity.
Rapid RTL-level microarchitectural iteration and evaluation on realistic workloads is enabled by a simulator that can meet these three objectives.
Our multi-level simulator combines functional ISA-level simulation, microarchitectural warmup models, and RTL simulation to deliver accurate IPC traces on long-running workloads to guide microarchitectural decision making.
The new paradigm of multi-level simulation that can reach down to the RTL-level opens the door to

\section{Introduction}

What is the typical microarchitectural design and iteration process?
What kinds of decisions do we want to make during the process?
What workloads do we use to evaluate our decisions?
Consider both parameter tuning as well as original microarchtectiual structures or optimizations within a given structure.

The spectrum of simulators that already exist and their limitations.

Why multi-level simulation?
Why not just go into perf simulators? - the correlation problem gets compounded 2x - sampling error + perf sim - RTL sim correlation errors
Aren't "trends" enough? Not when we care about small IPC changes! The absolute number matters! Also what are the special things we can get from RTL simulation that perf sim can't get us?
