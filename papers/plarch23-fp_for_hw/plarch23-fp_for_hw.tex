% We invite discussion on what other primitives can be embedded in a general-purpose language to enhance RTL design and verification.
% we're already familiar with this concept for HDLs implemented as eDSLs - but where else can we use this concept? I demonstrate 3 use cases: simcommand, parametric generators, sequences, recipes
% embedding is not only good because of ecosystem, but also because it allows you to leverage features of the host language like its FP support

% I make the case that this approach is good and can be applied to even more areas!
% What else can we embed to enable more expressive or performant hardware design and verification?

% HDLs as eDSLs
Over the past few decades, many RTL hardware design languages like Lava, Chisel, PyMTL3, and Amaranth have been implemented as DSLs embedded in a general-purpose programming language.
% Why we need more eDSLs beyond HW description for verif/design/collateral (e.g. for hammer)
Beyond RTL design, we believe that many other aspects of hardware design and verification would be served well with their own specialized DSLs.
% such as writing testbenches and stimulus generators, and designing control flow machines, would be served well with specialized DSLs.
% There are several aspects of hardware design and verification, that are not captured with existing eDSLs that mostly focus on RTL design.
% Embedded DSLs (eDSLs) should be leveraged to describe several aspects of hardware design and verification, beyond RTL design, to
% eDSLs in functional programming languages is perfect to create this multitude of DSLs - this is the best way!
Taking advantage of functional programming features in a host language makes creating \textit{functional APIs} for new eDSLs easy and ergonomic.
% to show this we will show 3 functional eDSLs in Scala
To show the value of this approach, we demonstrate three new eDSLs, embedded in a functional general-purpose programming language (Scala), specialized for testbench description, stimulus generation, and control flow compilation.

% beyond RTL design, such as testbenches, stimulus generators, and control flow compilation.
% We make the case that embedded DSLs are an ideal platform for HDLs, by leveraging their host languages to build \textit{functional APIs} for various aspects of hardware design and verification, such as RTL simulation, stimulus generation, and control flow compilation.

% \section{Functional Principles}
\section{Seperating Description from Interpretation}
% This design pattern is easy to implement with a monad
% ADTs
% Separating description from interpretation + combinators
% Customizable interpreters
% This technique has been applied to RTL-level HW design, but what other areas can we apply this to?

% Building APIs on the practical elements of functional programming provides several benefits beyond the mostly theoretical notions of referential transparency\cite{fpinscala}.
%Importantly, functional APIs seperate \textit{what to do} (the description) from \textit{how it is done} (the interpreter) (Figure \ref{fig:functional_apis}).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \begin{minted}[breaklines,fontsize=\small]{scala}

  def dequeue[T](io: DecoupledIO[T]): Command[T] = for {
      _ <- waitUntil(io.valid, 1)
      _ <- poke(io.ready, 1)
      value <- peek(io.bits)
      _ <- step(1)
  } yield value
  // Actually running the Command with unsafeRun
  val v = dequeue(queue.io).unsafeRun(queue.clock)
  \end{minted}

  \label{fig:simcommand}
  \vspace{-4.5mm}
  \end{figure}

%This notion is already well understood in the context of HDLs implemented as eDSLs.
The notion of separating \textit{what to do} (the description) from \textit{how it is done} (the interpreter) is already well understood in the context of HDLs implemented as eDSLs (Figure \ref{fig:functional_apis}).
eDSLs embed hardware primitives (datatypes, registers, memories, logical/arithmetic operators) and `connection' primitives (modules, IO ports, wires, bindings) in the host language as a set of algebraic data types (ADTs).
The RTL designer instantiates the primitives and connects them through a program written in the host language.
Here, \textit{the description}, is an in-memory representation of a circuit that is constructed when the program is executed, while \textit{the interpreter} turns that representation into output (e.g. FIRRTL\cite{firrtl}, CIRCT IR\cite{circt}, Verilog, SMT).

% In this paper we focus on functional embedded DSLs in Scala
An eDSL that splits description and interpretation is particularly well suited for a functional monadic implementation, leveraging three features of the host language: 1) algebraic data types, 2) monadic composition sugar (or direct style alternatives\cite{dotty_cps_async, koka}), and 3) a strong macro system for source annotations.
We will discuss three examples of functional eDSLs that leverage these features of the Scala language (Figure \ref{fig:edsl_overview}).
%The same principle of separating description from interpretation has many other useful applications in hardware design and verification, albeit with different primitives and interpreters.

%\section{SimCommand: Functional Testbench API}
\section{A Functional Testbench API}

% In Systmverilog you can design hardware and write testbenches, but in most modern eDSL HDLs
Popular testbench frameworks written in general-purpose languages already exist, such as cocotb\cite{cocotb} (Python) and chiseltest\cite{chiseltest} (Scala).
Writing testbenches in a general-purpose language is ergonomic and productive since it allows us to take advantage of the language's type system, libraries, build tools, IDEs, and testing frameworks.
However, these testbench libraries suffer from poor performance due to how they implement the \texttt{fork/join} primitives used for simulation threading.
To implement \texttt{fork/join}, chiseltest spawns a new JVM thread for each simulation thread, and uses mutexes to synchronize and yield control between threads.
This technique cannot keep up with the high frequency of suspend/resume operations in simulation threads, since it is bottlenecked by the overhead of mutex synchronization and thread parking and resumption.

% There are existing popular testbench frameworks... they are good because - general-purpose language allows you to make use of libraryes, debugging, etc.
% But the problem is they have poor performance, and we propose a functional eDSLs for chiseltest that shows significant perf improvmeent.
% While you can write testbenches in SystemVerilog, it is more ergonomic to use the same host language as your HDL, to exploit its features and share code.

%However, existing testbench APIs in general-purpose languages, such as chiseltest\cite{chiseltest} and cocotb\cite{cocotb}, have poor performance due to their implementation of \texttt{fork/join} used for simulation threading.
%We propose a functional eDSL, SimCommand\cite{simcommand}, which achieves fast \texttt{fork/join}, by embedding testbench primitives in Scala and separating testbench description and interpretation.

% Chiseltest uses JVM threads and mutexes, while cocotb uses Python's async/await coroutines to implement \texttt{fork/join}.
% Only talk about chiseltest!

To alleviate this problem, we propose a functional eDSL for writing testbenches, SimCommand\cite{simcommand}, which achieves fast \texttt{fork/join}, by embedding testbench primitives in Scala and separating testbench description and interpretation.
Cooperatively yielding simulation threads that can suspend/resume quickly are implemented through a monadic composition of testbench primitives\cite{hardcaml_step_testbench}.

\end{figure*}

The core ADT is a \texttt{Command[R]}, which describes a testbench operation that eventually terminates with a value of type \texttt{R}.
The primitives include testbench operations such as \texttt{peek} and \texttt{poke} to sense and drive RTL signals, \texttt{step} to advance the clock, and \texttt{fork} and \texttt{join} to describe simulation threads.
See the example in Figure \ref{fig:simcommand} which uses Scala's for-comprehension syntax to sequentially compose \texttt{Command} primitives into a larger program using continuation-passing style under the hood.

The SimCommand interpreter works as follows (Figure \ref{fig:simcommand_interp}): on every timestep, each thread (a pointer to a \texttt{Command}), is run until it hits a \texttt{step} or \texttt{join} (a yield point).
Once all threads have run to their yield point, the scheduler steps the clock in the underlying RTL simulator and repeats the process until the main thread finishes.
% and all recursively spawned threads have done the same,

SimCommand has several other features including channels for inter-thread communication, cycle-skipping optimizations, and runtime checks for thread order dependencies.
Separating description and interpretation yields an API that's 10-30x faster than cocotb and chiseltest, while being purely functional.

% Advantages:
% Fast fork/join
% Cycle skipping
% Deterministic channels
% Instrumentation to Verilog testbench built into interpreter
% Fixpoint iteration
% Catching thread ordering issues at runtime

\section{Parametric Stimulus Generation}

Traditionally, stimulus generation uses either imperative generators (e.g. \texttt{Gen} from QuickCheck\cite{quickcheck}) or declarative constraint solvers (e.g. SystemVerilog + UVM constrained random\cite{riscv_dv}).
We propose a hybrid API that mixes the sequential chaining support of \texttt{Gen}-style generators with the ergonomics of declarative constrained random APIs.
Our interpreter lets us specify a source of randomness; either an external library or a user-provided byte stream.
This feature enables parametric fuzzing\cite{zest} of hardware designs (Figure \ref{fig:parametric_fuzzing}).

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{minted}[breaklines,fontsize=\small]{scala}
val seqGen: Gen[Seq[Int]] = for {
  lit <- Gen.range(1, 100)
  tailGen <- Gen.oneOf(Gen(Seq()) -> 0.1, seqGen -> 0.9),
  seqn <- tailGen.map(t => lit +: t)
} yield seqn
seqGen.generate(ScalaRandom(seed=10))
seqGen.generate(ParametricRandom(Seq[Byte](...)))
\end{minted}
%// Seq(9, 8, 3)
%// Seq(6, 7, 0, 9, 0, 7)
\caption{Generating a sequence of integers between 0 and 100 with an average length of 10. The same description can be interpreted with PRNG or parametric randomness sources.}
\label{fig:randomapi}
\end{figure}

Separating the \textit{description of how} to generate stimulus, from the actual generation itself, allows us to easily switch out the source of randomness (Figure \ref{fig:randomapi}).
% cleanly separates the generation algorithm from the source of randomness (Figure \ref{fig:randomapi}).
This design decision also allows us to easily capture random decisions made during stimulus generation.
% to obtain a detailed \textit{description of the interpretation}.
These choices made by the generator can be used to improve the stimulus generation by having a fuzzer's mutator operate directly on the decision tree.
% One more sentence about ML
The decision tree can also be used to produce an embedding of the generated stimulus, to train ML models, e.g., for coverage prediction.
% There are also opportunities to instrument the interpreter to produce a decision tree, which can serve as a high-level embedding of the stimulus.
%opportunity to inject instrumentation in the interpreter to capture random decisions

\end{figure}

% This section is too immature and doesn't reflect the Property[T,S] type signature
% \section{Temporal Property eDSL}
%
% A temporal property specification language (similar to SVA\cite{sva_book} or PSL\cite{psl_book}) can also be expressed as a frontend API\cite{cha} that separates property specification from how it is implemented.
% We have prototyped an eDSL\cite{chisel_sequences} for defining temporal properties inside Chisel \texttt{Modules} and an interpreter which can convert properties to step-by-step monitor automata or optimized automata using Spot\cite{spot2}.
%
% \begin{figure}

% class MemXactor extends Module {
%   val prop: Property = (io.req |-> ###(1,2) io.ack)
% }
% \end{minted}
% \caption{This API is hypothetical.}
% \end{figure}

\section{Compiling Imperative Control Flow to FSMs}

Manually translating imperative control flow to FSMs in RTL is error-prone and laborious.
To address this, we have developed an eDSL\cite{chisel_recipes}, based on Blarney's Recipe construct\cite{blarney}, that lets you describe a sequence of imperative actions that are compiled to RTL (Figure \ref{fig:recipes}).
Since designers often want to set external signals based on which ``line'' of code is active, the Recipe primitives have an `\texttt{active}' signal tap that can be routed to a user-defined wire.
Since the control description and FSM compiler are cleanly separated, in the future, we could use a lightweight HLS IR (e.g. Calyx\cite{calyx}) to produce an optimized FSM.
The FSM compiler can inject debug \texttt{printf}s that fire when a line is entered and exited, and we leverage Scala's implicits\cite{sourcecode} to inject source line numbers into each primitive instantiation.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minted}[breaklines,fontsize=\small]{scala}
val readOnce = recipe(
  waitUntil(axi.ar_valid === 1.B, active=axi.ar_ready),
  action {
    axi.r_data := mem.read(axi.ar_addr)
    axi.r_valid := 1.B
  },
  waitUntil(axi.r_ready === 1.B, active=axi.r_valid),
  tick()
).compile()
\end{minted}
\caption{An imperative description of reading from a memory from an AXI4-Lite port.}
% Note that we can tap the `\texttt{active}' signal of any line to set external signals.
\label{fig:recipes}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

% Leverage Scala's for-comprehension (similar to Haskell's do-notation) for monadic composition.
% Very powerful technique, should be applied even more! What else can we embed in a host language and interact with existing HDLs (e.g. Chisel)?

We make the case that eDSLs need not be limited to HDLs, and we want to see more DSLs that model various abstractions used in hardware design and verification.
Leveraging the functional programming constructs of the host language and existing embedded HDLs, makes it straightforward to write APIs for RTL testbenches, stimulus generation, and control flow compilation.
What other aspects of hardware design ought to be first-class DSLs?
